# matrix2d
A simple, header-only 3x2 matrix reference implementation for 2D game programming.

The earliest standard supported is C++14 (GCC/Clang/MSVC), although it may also work in C++11 mode with a modern compiler.
> GCC and Clang seem to work in C++11 mode, but Clang will produce warnings about unsupported usage of `constexpr`.
